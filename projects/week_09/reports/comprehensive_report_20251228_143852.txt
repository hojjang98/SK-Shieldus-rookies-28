SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

1. SQL Injection Prevention:
   - Use parameterized queries (prepared statements)
   - Implement input validation and sanitization
   - Use ORM frameworks with built-in protections

2. XSS Prevention:
   - Implement output encoding/escaping
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Validate and sanitize user inputs

3. CSRF Prevention:
   - Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
   - Use SameSite cookie attribute
   - Verify Origin and Referer headers

4. File Upload Security:
   - Validate file extensions (whitelist approach)
   - Verify file content (magic bytes)
   - Store uploaded files outside web root
   - Implement file size limits
   - Rename uploaded files
